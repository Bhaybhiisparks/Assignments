# Week 4 NodeJS Task: Inheritance, Functions / Arrow Functions, Cookies, Promises and Async

A number guessing game to generate
 a number between the range of 1 and 2. 
 The game prompts users for their username.
A range as function parameter is set and
 players are prompted to predict the generated number between
 the given range. At a correct guess, the game
 should award the player a point and move them
 to stage 2 by increasing the range limit value 
 by 1, e.g. range is from 1 and 3 for 
 stage 2 and so on.
